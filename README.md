Hi everyone 👋

A few months ago I started to explore the Bower BI, the tool which is designed to provide actionable insights 💡 and drive business results 📊.
While studying, I discovered the most proactive way to implement theoretical knowledge 📚 in practice 💻.
Accidentally, I came across the "POWER BI ANALYTICS CHALLENGE" from CASERS. The objective was to find insights from the provided data, along with answering some concrete questions ❓. Here are some of them:

1) Whether the sharp increase in the cost of wagons is connected with the total freight?

2) Visualize the dynamics of grain shipments over the months.

3) Visualize the accumulated volume of Grains to Ports for 2019/20 - 2020/21.

4) Visualization of the directions of transportation in the ports from July to December 2021
